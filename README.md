#Entertainment Web App
The Entertainment Web App is a user-friendly web application that provides a seamless movie and show browsing experience. Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, it features a clean, modern design and intuitive navigation. The app includes key pages such as Home, Profile, Movies, Shows, and Bookmarked, each wrapped in a consistent layout. It uses protected routes to ensure secure access to certain pages and leverages React Router for efficient navigation. Context providers are used for managing authentication and search functionality. This project exemplifies the effective use of modern web technologies to create a functional and visually appealing application.
